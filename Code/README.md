# Music Composition Code

Code consist of four parts

1. pre-processing, converting CSV files to notes sequences and other musical information
2. learning, optimizing parameters of HMM by Baum-Welch
3. generating, using optimized parameters to generate new pieces
4. comparision, evaluate the performance of models by given metrics

## One Sequence

Code for dilated convolution model with single input

## Multiple Sequences

Code for dilated convolution model with multiple input
